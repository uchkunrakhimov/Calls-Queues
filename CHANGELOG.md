### v0.0.0

1. The React project is created using [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/).
2. I've opted for [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) to handle the project's CSS.
3. While the appearance might undergo up to a 20% change, or potentially more, my aim is to retain elements of the old design. This way, users accustomed to the previous interface can transition without significant disruption.
4. I'll begin by creating a static view and then proceed to learn the backend processes required to transform the interface into a fully real-time experience.

### v0.0.1

- The backend part is built
- Requests to Graphql are currently being sent in polling mode
- In the frontend, all data is received, placed in a table
- Left a window to get data from graphql in real-time in the frontend
