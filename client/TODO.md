1. The React project is created using [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/).
2. I've opted for [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) to handle the project's CSS.
3. While the appearance might undergo up to a 20% change, or potentially more, my aim is to retain elements of the old design. This way, users accustomed to the previous interface can transition without significant disruption.
4. I'll begin by creating a static view and then proceed to learn the backend processes required to transform the interface into a fully real-time experience.
